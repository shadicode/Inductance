# Simple Arduino-based Inductance Meter


I find the AVR  LC meter with frequency measurement project by Kerry D. Wong very helpful,
it made me understand the concept behind the measurement . 
The schematic and Arduino code based on similar project by  ReiBot.org. 
This meter is not very accurate compared with profesional ones but it does the job.

Update: A better Arduino sketch by ultimoistante:
